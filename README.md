🌊 Buoy Byte – DIY Micro:bit Wave Sensor for Water Motion

Buoy Byte is a fun, DIY wave sensor that measures water motion using two Micro:bit boards and the built-in accelerometer—no extra sensors needed! Just grab any plastic bottle 🍼, add some foam for buoyancy 🟢, and place a Micro:bit inside. On shore, the second Micro:bit receives the wave data wirelessly 📡. For better range, mount the shore Micro:bit on a stick above water level 🌴.

All wave movements are captured in real-time and can be logged through the serial port for experiments, visualization, or learning.

Key Features:

Fully DIY wave measurement using only Micro:bit and built-in accelerometer ⚡

No extra electronics required

Buoy can be made from any plastic bottle + foam for floatation 🍼🟢

Shore receiver can be raised on a stick to increase wireless range 🌴

Real-time wave data logging via serial port 🖥️

Perfect for STEM projects, hobbyist experiments, and educational demos 🎓


Use Cases:

Track small-scale water motion in ponds, lakes, or pools

Hands-on learning of accelerometers and wireless communication

Collect wave data for science projects or classroom experiments
